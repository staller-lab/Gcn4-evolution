Description of python analysis scripts

Step2_AddSeqFeaturestoDataFrame_Oct_2024.ipynb
Combines the data from the two replicates.
Computes many sequence features, like net charge.


AD_AlignmentDists.ipynb
This script looks at the Edit distances between pairs of sequences. It shows that many changes in sequence do not change activity.


AD_properties Fall 2024.ipynb
- This script explores how sequence properties, like AA abundance or motif locations, contribute to activation domain activity.
- Contains main figure panels


Composition_ANOVA Fall 2024.ipynb
ANOVA analysis of OLS regression on composition and dipeptides


Controls_oct024.ipynb
Barplots for control sequences
Reproducibility analysis


Full_Length_TFs_Heatmaps_Fall 2024.ipynb
Script to make heatmaps of full-length orthologs 


Sensu strictu v2.ipynb
Plot activity traces of S. cerevisiae and closest species


Gaussian_Threshold.ipynb
Analysis of inactive sequences to find activity threshold


YeastAnalysisfunctions.py
- Support functions for visualizing data
